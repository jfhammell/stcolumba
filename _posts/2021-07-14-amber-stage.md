The Anglican Diocese of Ottawa has given permission for parishes to resume worship services.  Starting September 5, 2021 we will resume in-person worship services, keeping in place our precautions for COVID-19.  Some of these precautions include:
 - everyone is required to wear a mask at all times indoors;
 - everyone must remain physically distanced;
 - capacity of the church is reduced to no more than 50 people;
 - signs will be posted that will inform people on the symptoms of COVID-19 request staying away and get tested if you have any of the symptoms;
 - everyone must enter by the front door and exit by the side door to avoid congestion;
 - no singing by the congregation during the worship service;
 - at the Eucharist people will be served the wafer alone;
 - no coffee hour following the service;
 - increased cleaning and sanitization before and after the service.

The church was closed from January 2021 until July and during this time we have held virtual services via the Zoom conferencing service.  

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the [church office][1].
