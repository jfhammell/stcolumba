We have resumed in-person worship services, following guidance from the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa with precautions for COVID-19.  We are currently in the Yellow stage of the pandemic plan, with the following precautions:
 - everyone is required to wear a mask at all times indoors;
 - everyone must remain physically distanced;
 - capacity of the church is reduced to no more than 50 people;
 - signs will be posted that will inform people on the symptoms of COVID-19 request staying away and get tested if you have any of the symptoms;
 - everyone must enter by the front door and exit by the side door to avoid congestion;
 - quiet singing by the congregation is allowed during the worship service;
 - at the Eucharist people will be served the wafer alone;
 - fellowship hour following the service has resumed with people spread out in John Stewart Hall;
 - increased cleaning and sanitization before and after the service.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the [church office][1].
