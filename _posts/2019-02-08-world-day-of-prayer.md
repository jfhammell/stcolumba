The service in our area is being held at McKay United Church, 39 Dufferin Avenue, on Friday, 1 March at 7:00 pm. On that day, Christian women in Slovenia invite us to "Come to the table â€“ everything is ready!" and ask us to consider, "Who is not at the table?" (The Parable of the Banquet, Luke 14:15-24.) This is an opportunity to learn about the country of Slovenia and to join with its people in prayer and action.  More information about the program can be found on the [International World Day of Prayer website][1].
