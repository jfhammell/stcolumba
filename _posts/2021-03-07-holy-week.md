Unfortunately, due to Ottawa moving into provincial red zone restrictions, we are unable re-open for in-person worship in time for Holy Week.  Therefore, the following services will be held online via Zoom.

* **Palm Sunday**, March 28, 2021 - 9:30am.
* **Maundy Thursday**, April 1, 2021 - 7:00pm.
* **Good Friday**, April 2, 2021 - 10:00am.
* **Easter Sunday**, April 4, 2021 - 9:30am.
