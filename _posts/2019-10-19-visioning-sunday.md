Karen has organized a parish visioning day on Sunday, November 3rd, 2019
following morning prayer. It has been many years since the parish has such a
discussion and Karen is anxious to hear from all parishoners about what we love
about St Columba and our vision for the future. All parishoners are asked to try
to attend. We will be led by professional consultant and facilitator, Mike Coxon.
A light lunch will be provided and we plan to finish by 1:30pm.
