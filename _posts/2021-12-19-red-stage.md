As directed by the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa, we have moved immediately into the Red Stage restrictions of the Pandemic Plan.  In the Red Stage, non-essential access to the church facilities is prohibited.  This means that in-person worship services are suspended and the facility may not be used by community groups.  

While in the Red Stage we are hosting virtual worship services online via the Zoom conferencing system.  Joining the Zoom broadcast is free and can be done via mobile phone, computer or even telephone.  An invitation with meeting code is emailed weekly.  Please contact our [webmaster][2] to get the invitation.  

If you have any questions, please contact the [church office][1].
