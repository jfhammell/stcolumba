We are holding in-person worship services following the guidance from the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa with precautions for COVID-19.  We are currently in an updated Green stage (least restrictive) of the pandemic plan, with the following precautions:
 - the congregation is encouraged to wear a mask while indoors;
 - maintaining physical distance from others is encouraged;
 - signs are posted to inform people on the symptoms of COVID-19 and request staying away if you are experiencing any of the symptoms;
 - everyone is encouraged to enter by the front door and exit by the side door to avoid congestion;
 - fellowship hour following the service has resumed in John Stewart Hall;
 - increased cleaning and sanitization before and after the service continues.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the [church office][1].
