This yearâ€™s Bales packing day at St. Columba will be on <b>Wed. 29 May from 9:00 a.m. until noon</b>, with assembling of cartons on the previous evening at 7:00 p.m.  For details of welcomed items see the list in the John Stewart Hall.  Now is a good time to find bargains at end-of-season sales! See Judy if you have questions.
