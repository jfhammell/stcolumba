Holy week commemorates the events which preceded our Lord's resurrection, beginning on Palm Sunday with his triumphal entry into Jerusalem.  As Christians, we recall the final meal Jesus had with his disciples and his institution of the sacrament of the Eucharist. On Friday we commemorate Christ's agony and death on the cross and then as the day of resurrection dawned, the joyful celebration of Easter.
