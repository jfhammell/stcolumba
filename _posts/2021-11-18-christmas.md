Unfortunately, due to rising numbers of COVID-19 cases, we have been directed by the Anglican Diocese of Ottawa to cancel our in-person Christmas services.  We have decided to hold the following services online over the Zoom conferencing service:
* **Christmas Eve** over Zoom, December 24, 9:00pm.
* **Christmas 1** over Zoom, December 26, 9:30am.

We have cancelled our 4pm Christmas Eve Service of Light and our Christmas morning service.  

Joining the Zoom broadcast is free and can be done via mobile phone, computer or even telephone.  An invitation with meeting code will be emailed.  Please contact our [webmaster][1] to get the invitation.
