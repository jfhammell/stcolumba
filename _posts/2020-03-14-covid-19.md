Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, all worship services are currently suspended on advice of the provincial government and Ottawa Diocese.  St Columba is following this guidance and we encourage all to stay safe and healthy.

The weekly readings and the Rev'd Karen's reflection are being emailed out to parishioners.  Contact the church office if you would like to be added to the email list or would like a paper copy delivered to your mailbox.
