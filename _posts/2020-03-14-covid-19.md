Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, all in-person worship services are currently suspended on advice of the provincial government and Ottawa Diocese.  St Columba is following this guidance and we encourage all to stay safe and healthy.

We have started hosting weekly virtual services via the Zoom conferencing service.  To receive the invite and instructions on how to join, please contact the [webmaster][1].  The weekly readings and the Rev'd Karen's reflection are also being emailed out to parishioners.  Contact the [church office][2] if you would like to be added to the email list or would like a paper copy delivered to your mailbox.
