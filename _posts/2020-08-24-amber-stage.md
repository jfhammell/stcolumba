The Anglican Diocese of Ottawa has given permission for parishes to resume worship services starting in September with a number of precautions for COVID-19.  Some of these precautions include:
 - everyone is required to wear a mask at all times indoors;
 - everyone must remain physically distanced;
 - capacity of the church is reduced to no more than 50 people;
 - signs will be posted that will inform people on the symptoms of COVID-19 request staying away and get tested if you have any of the symptoms;
 - everyone must enter by the front door and exit by the side door to avoid congestion;
 - no singing during the worship service;
 - at the Eucharist people will be served the wafer alone;
 - no coffee hour following the service;
 - increased cleaning and sanitization before and after the service.

The church has been closed since March and during this time a few of us have been able to participate in virtual services via the Zoom conferencing service.  Many people are probably eager to resume our in-person worship services.  Please be patient and bare with us while we try to ensure everyone remains safe.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the [church office][1].
