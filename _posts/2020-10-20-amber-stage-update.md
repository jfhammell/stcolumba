The Anglican Diocese of Ottawa Pandemic Plan outlines our precautions to reduce the chance of transimission of the coronavirus.  This plan is continually reviewed to ensure our church follows these precautions.  Some of these precautions related to our worship services include the following:
 - everyone is required to wear a mask at all times indoors;
 - everyone must remain physically distanced;
 - capacity of the church is reduced to no more than 50 people;
 - signs are posted that inform people on the symptoms of COVID-19 and we request you stay home and get tested if you have any of the symptoms;
 - everyone must enter by the front door and exit by the side door to avoid congestion;
 - no singing by the congregation during the worship service;
 - at the Eucharist people will be served the wafer alone;
 - no coffee hour following the service;
 - increased cleaning and sanitization before and after the service.

The church re-opened for in-person worship services starting in September.  Previously, from March until end of August, we held virtual services via the Zoom conferencing service.  

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the [church office][1].
