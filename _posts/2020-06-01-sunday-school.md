St Columba's Sunday School has restarted over the Zoom conferencing system.  Despite not being able to meet and do crafts in person, we are excited to be able to offer this weekly half-hour session with our new Sunday School teacher, Brandon Rabideau.

If you have children of age 12 or younger and are interested in introducing them to the teachings of Christ in a safe, friendly and welcoming environment, please contact the [webmaster][1] or [church office][2] to get the Zoom meeting invitation.
