The Community Garden at St Columba has flourished in its first year.  Many trips with harvested vegetables from the plots of our parishioners has been donated to the Ottawa Food Bank.  

The Community Garden organizers asked if the church would consider expanding the footprint to provide an additional 6-12 raised garden boxes.  St Columba parishioners have supported this proposal.
