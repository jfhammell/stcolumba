Ottawa City Councillor, Rawlson King, will be our guest speaker for the first Sunday in Lent on February 26.  As Ottawa's first black City Councillor, we are honoured to have him join us on the last Sunday of Black History Month.  Councillor King will be speaking about the Ottawa's Affordable Housing Strategy.  

Everyone is welcome, but we strongly encourage all who attend to weak masks.  You are also invited to stay for a time of fellowship and refreshment following the service.
