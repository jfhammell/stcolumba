Join us on Trinity Sunday, <b>June 16, 2019, 9:30am</b>, for some special music, featuring guest soloist Shawn Mattas.

We will also be gathering in the John Stewart Hall after the service to say goodbye to the Rev'd Canon Robert Heard, his wife Beverley and our dear friends Randy and Theresa Wilson.
