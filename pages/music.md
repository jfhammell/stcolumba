The choir is led by our organist, Faye Grinberg-Rice. Hymns are from *Common Praise*, the blue Anglican hymnal published in 1998.

The music for the Kyrie, Sursum Corda, Sanctus, Benedictus, and the Lordâ€™s Prayer are all arranged by Robert Fleming; the Gloria and Agnus Dei are arranged by our former organist, Carol Parker.

The choir rehearses Thursday evenings. All are welcome to join.
