The Altar Guild is a group of parish volunteers responsible for the care of the sanctuary, the sacred vessels, the vestments, and the linens. St. Columbaâ€™s Altar Guild formed in 1952 and remains a dedicated group. Each week, members of the Altar Guild clean the sanctuary, lay out the vestments, trim and replace candles, prepare the vessels and arrange the altar flowers in the sacristy and then place them on the altar.

The Altar Guild accepts donations for the purchase of the altar flowers. A sign-up sheet for altar flower donations corresponding to each week of the year can be found in the narthex. After the service, the Altar Guild will wrap up the flowers and give them to someone named by the donor, or a parishioner who would appreciate them.

## Holly Sale

Starting in 1962, the Altar Guild has organized an annual Holly Sale in the Christmas season. Before the sale, members of the guild meet in the church hall to bag the holly. Baking, jams and jellies made by guild members and parishoners are also sold at this highly anticipated community event.
