Supporting children in our community, every fall St Columba donates school supplies to the [Wabano Centre for Aboriginal Health](http://www.wabano.com/).

Each May in support of the Anglican Church Women (ACW), St Columba is one of the locations for the packing of [Bales for the North](http://acwottawa.wixsite.com/acw-ottawa/bales-for-the-north). Many of the items donated by Anglican parishes throughout the Diocese are brought to St Columba, where they are sorted, packed and prepared for shipping to northern communities.  St Columba parishioners also generously donate needed items. For more information, please go to the ACW website for a full list of requested items or contact the [parish office][1].

St Columba supports the annual Christmas Party held at [Centre 454](http://www.centre454.ca/) through the purchase of small gifts for the men, women and children who attend this event.  

[Primates World Relief Development Fund](http://pwrdf.org/) (PWRDF) is Canada's Anglican response for emergency relief, refugees, development and justice. Most recently PWRDF had a special appeal for the Al Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza City, which has been supported for many years by this organization.

The [Ottawa Anglican Diocese](https://ottawa.anglican.ca/community-ministries/) has a number of community ministry and outreach
programs, including [Cornerstone](http://www.cornerstonewomen.ca/) (emergency shelter and supportive housing
for a diversity of women), [The Well](http://www.the-well.ca/) (a safe gathering place providing meals,
services, and resources for women and women with children living with
poverty and issues surrounding homelessness), [St. Luke's Table](http://www.stlukestable.ca/) (a day
program which provides services, support, and meals for those who are
homeless or at risk of homelessness), [Centre 454](http://www.centre454.ca/) (an award-winning, daytime
drop-in centre for those experiencing homelessness, poverty, or inadequate
housing) and [Ottawa Pastoral Counselling Centre](http://www.ottawapastoralcounsellingcentre.ca/) (offering counselling and
psychotherapy services to individuals, couples, and families including
children and teens).
