Regular services of Holy Eucharist (communion) are held weekly at 10:00 am.
Everyone is invited to take part in the Eucharist (Communion). Gluten-free host is available upon request.

Prayer is a significant and integral part of the worship service.  The
Prayers of the People are led by individual parishioners.  Included each
week are those in the [Ottawa Diocese Prayer Calendar][1] as well as the worldwide [Anglican Cycle of Prayer][2].  The Prayers of the People also
include the names of individuals for whom the congregation has asked to
remember in prayer.  

Members of the congregation participate in many aspects of the worship
service, as greeters, choristers, readers of the scripture lessons, leading
the prayers and Psalm, etc.  This makes for an inclusive environment in
which to worship together.  

Special Services take place throughout the year - Ash Wednesday, Good
Friday, Christmas Eve, Thanksgiving, Blessing of the Animals, etc.  For more
information about upcoming special services, please continue to check this
website or contact the [parish office][3] (or 613-749-5103).
