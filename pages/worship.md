Our regular services of Holy Eucharist follow the *Book of Alternative Services* (BAS). Everyone is invited to take part in the Eucharist (Communion). The wine and host are typically received at the altar rail. Gluten-free host is available.

We follow the [Ottawa Diocese Prayer Calendar][1] as well as the worldwide [Anglican Cycle of Prayer][2]. We also pray for individuals known to members of the parish.
