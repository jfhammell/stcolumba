> ... serve one another with whatever gift each of you has received.
<cite>1 Peter 4:10</cite>

Time is a gift and we thank all those who assist in the life of the church.  [Contact us][1] to volunteer in our ministry.  

Financial gifts through the weekly free-will offering collected during the service as well as regular or one-time donations enable us to keep the church doors open and provide services to our community through our [outreach programs][2].  

Financial donations may be made securely online [below](#donation-form), via pre-authorized debit (PAR), or via a personal cheque made out to "Church of St Columba".  We are a registered charity (BN:108084658RR0049) and donations will be issued tax receipts.  Online donations will receive tax receipts immediately from CanadaHelps.org; other donors will be issued tax receipts covering the entire year in early January.
